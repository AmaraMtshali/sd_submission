        <h3>Latest Project</h3>
        <p>The most impressive work i have done yet was being part of a team Datageddon that won the IBM datathon hosted last year in Pretoria. <br>It included building a machine learning model that leverages environmental cues and identifies danger through those environmental cues. <br> E.g Gun shot sound would be detected through the model and it would notify nearby people who are using the Sound busters sysytem. We have scaled the project to a full blown application that will be web based as well as mobile ,integrating models that leverage computer vision is part of the scaling criteria but futher research is being conducted for this.
